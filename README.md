# Kaleb's Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Control the snake, eat apples to grow, and avoid collisions with the screen edges and your own tail. The game ends when the snake hits the boundary or itself. Your score increases as you eat more apples.

## Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Scoring System:** Score increments by 10 for each apple the snake eats.
- **Game Over Screen:** Displays "Game Over" message when the game ends.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Apple positions are generated randomly, and the snake grows as it consumes apples.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame** library

Install Pygame by running:

```bash
pip install pygame
